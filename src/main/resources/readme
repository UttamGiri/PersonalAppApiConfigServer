ASSYMETRIC ENCRYPTION

algorithm = AES RSA   

alias = encyptAPIKey
CN = common name
OU (Oraganizational Unit)
O= Organization name or domain
L=(Location)
S=(State)
C=(Country)
keypass= password  make complicated
keystore can be any name make sure .jks is there  , basically this is the name of file that contain public (Encryption) and private key (Decryption)
storepass= protect integrity of keystore file , both password should be at least 6 character long

for simplicity use both password same

keytool -genkeypair -alias encyptAPIKey3 -keyalg RSA -dname "CN=Uttam Giri,OU=Personal API Development Department,O=koklmani.com,L=Jacksonville,S=Florida,C=USA" -keypass 1werhdsr -keystore encyptAPIKey3.jks -storepass 1werhdsr



now post call

http://localhost:8012/encrypt  eg -  giri  

http://localhost:8012/decrypt  generate value

inorder to use in project you have to use {cipher} generatedvalue
